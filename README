This is a simble template for firmware development for stm32 microcontroller
with gcc compiler on linux host.

In this template are integrated:

- startup files with interrupt vectors tables
- STM StdPeriph libraries for F1XX and F4XX series
- ScmRTOS realtime system
- FreeRTOS realtime system
- mini printf function
- flashing and debugging with st-util
- examples for STM3210C evaluation board
- examples for STM32 VL Discovery evaluation board
- examples for STM32 F4 Discovery evaluation board


TODO: 
- retarget printf to usart
- integration new function for c++ projects
- more examples

For start you need:
1) configure your compiler in Makefile.common
2) run "sh ./make_libs.sh"
3) build one example with "make"
4) run st-util in other terminal
5) run the application with "make run".
